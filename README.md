- Create a list to hold your employees
  - Each employee should be a dictionary. The keys should be ‘First Name’, ‘Last Name’, ‘Birth Year’, and  ‘Email’
- Prompt the user to say how many employees they will add
  - Use error handling to repeat the prompt until an integer is entered
  - Optional: add a max number of employees
- Loop for each employee and record their information
  - Use error handling to repeat the prompt until an integer is entered for age
  - Optional: raise an Error if the employee is under 18
